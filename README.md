DOG BREED IDENTIFIER    
***
This project is designed to take a DNA sequence of an unknown dog breed and 
compare it against a preselected database compiled of identified dog breeds.
Resulting in an identification of the closest sequence in the database to the provided sequence.
***
Used data:

The `dog_breeds.fa` file contains the sequence in our database, to compare against.

The `mystery.fa` sequence contains a sequence from an unknown dog type, and we want to identify what is the closest breed 
to it in our database.

Used packages/classes/modules/...:
